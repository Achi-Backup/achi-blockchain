    Achi is a truly decentralized cryptocurrency based on a Proof of Space (PoSp) and Proof of Time (PoT) consensus algorithm with independent Timelords.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Achi plots are incompatible with other PoSp and PoT blockchains. Incompatibility of Achi plots with other blockchains will help Achi to gain maximum decentralization and become an unique cryptocurrency with high long term potential.

### Advantages of Achi in comparison with other PoSp and PoT cryptocurrencies:

* Achi is not managed or controlled by a company or anyone else. It has been launched on Aug 14, 2021 00:05:21 JST as open source blockchain and allowed to fly independently and decentralized with community support.
* Achi is the first PoSp and PoT blockchain with independent Timelords which take 0.02% commission of Achi coins for each signed block. Everyone can run their Timelords. This is another way to earn Achi coins and it incetivise 3rd parties to run timelords competitively
* Achi has no pre-farming, it starts from 0.
* There will be 21 billions of Achi coins produced during the next 58.2 years.
* Farmers who join Achi early years are very well incentivised because the blockchain needs security the most at the start. During the next two years there will be 7.78 billions of Achi coins produced.
* Due to security reasons Achi has K=32+ plots which are incompatible with other PoSp and PoT blockchains.

### Achi's emission schedule:

Achi starts with 2^15 coins per 1 signed block. After (2^3)x4608 blocks we have halving. Blockchain will pay 2^14 coins per signed block after the first halving. The second halving will be after next (2^4)x4608 signed blocks. Blockchain will pay 2^13 coins per signed block after the second halving. The third halving will be after next (2^5)x4608 blocks and so on. Overall Achi blockchain will have 2^3=8 halvings. Starting from (2^11)x4608+1 block Achi blockchain will pay (2^7) coins per signed block forever.

Halving will be stopped after around 5.5 years.

There will be 215'285'760 of Achi coins produced every year after 8 halvings.

There will be 21 billions of Achi coins produced over the next 58.2 years.
